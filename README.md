Trying this out for the first time
I am the very model of a scientist salarian, I've studied species turian, asari, and batarian.
I'm quite good at genetics (as a subset of biology) because i am an expert (which i know is a tautology). 
My xenoscience studies range from urban to agrarian, I am the very model of a scientist salarian.
